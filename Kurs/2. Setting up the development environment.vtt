00:00.550 --> 00:05.710
So before we start building our application we're going to need some software to help us build this.

00:05.710 --> 00:08.730
Now we're using dot net core for our web API.

00:08.760 --> 00:14.850
So what we need to download and install is the dot net core SDK from Microsoft.

00:14.860 --> 00:20.500
Now you can get this from dot net dot Microsoft dot com and this will take you to the home page.

00:20.500 --> 00:25.570
And I'm just going to go to the download section now the latest version released of dot net core is

00:25.570 --> 00:33.670
version 2.0 2 at the time of recording and also at the time of recording dot net core 3.0 is in preview

00:33.670 --> 00:34.170
mode.

00:34.180 --> 00:39.550
So if some things in preview mode I wouldn't recommend installing that for a training course because

00:39.940 --> 00:44.830
whilst the code that we write is going to be the same I've taken a look at the preview and the code

00:44.830 --> 00:49.960
that we're writing is the same what you might have an issue with is when we add additional packages

00:50.320 --> 00:54.190
later on you might have a problem if you're using dot net core 3.0.

00:54.670 --> 01:01.450
So what I'd recommend is just grab the latest version just click the download and for dot net core SDK

01:01.810 --> 01:05.080
this will give you the latest released version of this SDK.

01:05.710 --> 01:10.090
And like I say at the moment it's on dot net core to point to.

01:10.210 --> 01:15.370
And once you've downloaded and installed this hour and so your intelligence by showing you how to install

01:15.370 --> 01:16.170
software.

01:16.270 --> 01:20.710
But once you do have it installed and just come into a terminal or a command prompt window.

01:20.710 --> 01:24.660
And this will give you access to the dot net command line interface.

01:24.760 --> 01:32.530
And what we want to do is just typing dot net that stash info and this will tell you which SDK you have

01:32.530 --> 01:36.140
installed and which dot net core runtime you have installed.

01:36.250 --> 01:38.860
I have multiple of these installed side by side.

01:38.860 --> 01:40.300
That's absolutely fine.

01:40.300 --> 01:44.470
But it's not necessary for you to have all of the previous versions installed.

01:44.620 --> 01:47.630
Just make sure you've got the latest version available.

01:47.730 --> 01:53.270
I'm on the latest version available at a time of this recording is two point two for a one.

01:53.380 --> 02:00.880
And the host which is the version of the dot net runtime we're installing is two point two point six.

02:00.970 --> 02:07.030
The DOT SDK gives us access to the command line interface that we're using as well as the build tools

02:07.030 --> 02:14.080
to help us develop our application and the runtime is actually was used to host and run our complete

02:14.080 --> 02:15.140
application.

02:15.140 --> 02:19.550
So many by fan when we install the SDK we also get the runtime installed as well.

02:19.570 --> 02:21.100
So you need that for sure.

02:21.100 --> 02:29.170
For starters what we also need is nodes J.S. and this is a javascript runtime that we use with our angular

02:29.170 --> 02:36.820
application a set and tools that we need from no J.S. to help us build our angular application including

02:37.000 --> 02:42.990
a node package manager which will help us to install additional packages that we need to help us build

02:43.000 --> 02:47.600
that and the latest one available is twelve point nine point A.

02:47.860 --> 02:53.880
And I would recommend sticking to version twelve of this for angular version 8.

02:54.340 --> 03:01.100
It's hard to predict the types of problems you might experience with future releases of no J.S..

03:01.240 --> 03:07.100
So you're perfectly fine with either of these two versions even version 10 or version twelve.

03:07.300 --> 03:10.490
And once you have this installed then what you should be able to do.

03:10.690 --> 03:17.270
I'll just clear my console and what you should be able to do is type in node dash dash version and it

03:17.280 --> 03:21.720
will tell you which version of No G1 I'm on version twelve point eight point one so I didn't have the

03:22.170 --> 03:28.290
absolute latest but any versions 12 is fine or version 10 is fine as well.

03:28.950 --> 03:32.800
And what this gives us access to is a tool called NPM.

03:33.030 --> 03:40.560
And if I just type in NPM version then I'm on six point ten point two of LAX and we'll be using NPM

03:40.560 --> 03:48.240
to install various packages to help us build our angular application what we also need is a code that

03:48.320 --> 03:48.480
her.

03:48.510 --> 03:53.040
Now the one I'm using for all of the demos is visual studio code.

03:53.040 --> 03:59.400
This is an excellent free to use cross platform code editor that we can use to build and compile out

03:59.520 --> 04:00.810
dot net core code.

04:01.020 --> 04:07.120
And it's also excellent for typescript which is what we used to write our angular application.

04:07.230 --> 04:13.080
Now ever I.D. and code editors are available but when it comes to writing dot net core code you are

04:13.080 --> 04:20.760
restricted on ideas that are capable of compiling C sharp code and currently that means even using Visual

04:20.760 --> 04:23.170
Studio code as I'm showing here.

04:23.330 --> 04:29.630
Iva Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 the full versions are never available for Windows.

04:29.670 --> 04:36.390
There is a visual studio for Mac but the last time I used it was not a great experience so I wouldn't

04:36.390 --> 04:43.260
recommend that although it's been a while and there's also an ever IDC called rider from Jet brains

04:43.290 --> 04:46.660
which is also very good and that one is cross platform.

04:46.830 --> 04:49.950
But the downside to that one is it's not free.

04:49.950 --> 04:53.640
Now if you're just getting started I would highly recommend Visual Studio code.

04:53.670 --> 04:57.170
All of the demos it and in Visual Studio code from my side of things.

04:57.360 --> 05:02.550
So the experience should be identical for yourselves when you're coding along to go ahead and install

05:02.550 --> 05:05.000
this for your particular operating system.

05:05.010 --> 05:10.470
Another tool that will use is a tool called postman and we can get this from get postman dot com.

05:11.100 --> 05:17.100
And this is going to allow us to test and query our API without needing to use the browser.

05:17.220 --> 05:26.190
And on this page we should find a download button somewhere although I'm just saying information for

05:26.190 --> 05:32.370
buying tickets for our conference and we just want to go into the product where it's got postman and

05:32.370 --> 05:35.340
download this app and this is what we're looking for.

05:35.370 --> 05:38.640
So please do go ahead and download this as well.

05:38.640 --> 05:44.850
And the other tool will need because we're using secret life for development then it's useful to be

05:44.850 --> 05:51.720
able to browse the data lists inside that database and the tool that helps us do this is called DV browser

05:51.720 --> 05:53.220
for sequel lines.

05:53.220 --> 05:58.620
Now if you've never used secret light before line sequel II is really just a file based relational database

05:59.010 --> 06:04.680
and it's brilliant for development because we don't need to install a database server onto our computer

06:05.070 --> 06:06.520
and we can literally use this.

06:06.530 --> 06:11.070
Anyway it's very useful for development and I did mention earlier we won't be using it for production

06:11.520 --> 06:13.680
but it's super useful for development.

06:13.980 --> 06:16.680
So please do you go ahead and install this one as well.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.270
So now we've got the software installed.

06:18.270 --> 06:21.060
Next step will actually start creating our projects.
